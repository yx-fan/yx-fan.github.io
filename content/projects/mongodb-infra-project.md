In this project, I developed an automated deployment system for a **MongoDB Sharded Cluster** using **Docker** and **shell scripts**. The cluster architecture is designed to ensure **high availability**, **fault tolerance**, and **horizontal scalability**, making it ideal for handling large datasets across distributed nodes.

---

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to create a robust and scalable MongoDB infrastructure that efficiently manages **distributed data storage** while ensuring **data redundancy**. Through the use of **sharding** and **replica sets**, the system provides both **improved performance** and **resilience** against potential failures.

## Deploy MongoDB Cluster

### Cluster Components:

- **Config Server**: This handles the metadata and configuration for the sharded cluster. It directs the query router (mongos) to the appropriate shard for a given query.
- **Shard1 & Shard2**: These are MongoDB replica sets responsible for holding the distributed data. Each shard is a replica set to ensure redundancy, allowing the cluster to continue functioning even if one replica set goes down.

- **Mongos Router**: Acts as the query router for the client. It interacts with the config server to direct queries to the appropriate shard, making the system look like a single MongoDB instance to external clients.

The cluster architecture uses **Docker** to containerize each component. This ensures portability, simplifies scaling, and facilitates easier management of the cluster.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Docker**: Each MongoDB instance (config server, shards, and mongos) is containerized, making the deployment consistent and scalable.
- **Shell Scripts**: Custom scripts are used to automate the initialization of each replica set and the shard configuration, reducing the chance of manual errors.
- **Docker Compose**: Simplifies orchestration and management of multi-container setups, defining the configuration for all MongoDB instances in a single file.

- **Monitoring Tools**: Integration with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** ensures that the cluster is constantly monitored for performance and reliability.

---

## Cluster Architecture

The MongoDB cluster consists of:

- **Config Server**: Maintains metadata for the shards.
- **Shard1 and Shard2**: Data is distributed across these shards. Each shard is configured as a replica set for high availability.
- **Mongos Router**: Receives client queries and forwards them to the correct shard based on the metadata stored in the config server.

### Sharding and Replica Sets

- **Sharding**: Enables the system to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple shards. Each shard manages a subset of the total data.
- **Replica Sets**: Each shard operates as a replica set, which ensures that data is duplicated across multiple servers. This replication ensures that even if one server goes down, another can take over.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Data Replication and Fault Tolerance**: Ensuring efficient data replication across shards was critical. This was handled by configuring each shard as a replica set, ensuring data redundancy and high availability.

2. **Automating Cluster Initialization**: Automating the initialization of replica sets and shards involved creating detailed shell scripts that handled the startup sequence and ensured each component was initialized in the correct order.

3. **Scalability and Network Setup**: Isolating the MongoDB containers in a dedicated Docker network ensured secure communication between components while maintaining network isolation from external environments.

---

## Monitoring and Automation

In this project, I integrated **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor the cluster’s performance. This involved setting up **Prometheus** to collect metrics from MongoDB and **Grafana** for visualizing key metrics such as query performance, replication lag, and disk usage.

- **Prometheus**: Used to scrape and collect metrics from each MongoDB instance.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes performance metrics, giving insights into how the cluster is performing, and helps in diagnosing any issues that may arise.

## Conclusion

The **MongoDB Cluster Setup** project showcases the ability to automate the deployment of a sharded and replicated MongoDB cluster using Docker and shell scripts. By leveraging **sharding** and **replica sets**, the system can handle large datasets with high performance and fault tolerance. Additionally, with the integration of **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, the cluster is equipped with robust monitoring tools, making it easy to track performance and maintain operational efficiency.

This project demonstrates how automation and containerization can simplify the process of deploying and managing a complex distributed system like MongoDB, making it highly scalable and reliable for real-world applications.
