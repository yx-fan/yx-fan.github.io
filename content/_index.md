# Hi, I'm Yuxin Fan

I am a Full-Stack Developer with Financial Expertise, specializing in building scalable and secure backend systems while leveraging deep financial knowledge to drive business success. My experience includes developing robust IT architectures, designing blockchain-based solutions, and optimizing systems for performance and cost efficiency. I have led the development of Web3 platforms and integrated wallet-based authentication systems, ensuring high security and usability.

My strong background in finance, supported by certifications like CFA and FRM, enables me to deliver data-driven insights that optimize operational efficiency. Iâ€™ve contributed to projects involving mergers and acquisitions (DD), audit process improvements, and cost-saving initiatives through strategic data analysis. I bring a unique blend of technical innovation and financial acumen, ensuring that my solutions are both technically sound and aligned with business objectives.

By combining my skills in full-stack development and financial strategy, I create impactful solutions that address complex challenges in both technology and finance. My ability to bridge these domains allows me to design systems that are not only functional and scalable but also aligned with strategic goals for sustainable growth.
